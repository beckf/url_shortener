# URL Redirect
This is a simple php project that will allow you to run a URL shortener using your own domain.  Users authenticate to Active Directory through LDAP.  Users can manage, create, and delete their own short urls.  Database is mariaDB. 
 
## To Setup

### Setup Apache

Insert into Apache httpd.conf or .htaccess:


```
<Directory "/path/to/url/dir"> 
	RewriteEngine on 
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
	RewriteRule . redirect.php [L] 
</Directory>
```


This will redirect anything not found in directory to redirect.php which will check the SQL database.

###  Setup config.php
ldapServer = ip address/hostname of ldap server \
allowedGroups = CN of group that should be allowed access URLs \
host = hostname part of shorturl \
ad_domain = domain name of active directory domain to authenticate to
